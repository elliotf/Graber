# Changes made to the original Graber printer (other than a layout for 24x18 printers):

* Remove laser cut X axis
* Made top brace taller
* Moved electronics mounting holes further up the X motor side Z brace
* Provided mounting holes for a 12v power supply
* More holes in the Z braces to allow for better separation of motor, endstop, and power supply wiring
